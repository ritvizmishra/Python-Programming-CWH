### Python Programming
1. What is Programming?     
   Programming is the art and science of giving instructions to a computer so it can perform tasks. It involves designing algorithms, writing code in a programming language, testing for correctness, and debugging to ensure the desired outcome.

2. What is Python?  
   Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its clear syntax and readability. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, it emphasizes developer productivity and code maintainability.

3. Features of Python  
   - **Easy to Learn & Read**: Simple, English-like syntax reduces the cost of program maintenance.  
   - **Interpreted**: Python code is executed line by line, which makes debugging easier.  
   - **Dynamically Typed**: You don’t need to declare variable types explicitly; types are determined at runtime.  
   - **Extensive Standard Library**: Comes with modules for everything from file I/O to web services.  
   - **Cross-Platform**: Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, and more without changing the code.
