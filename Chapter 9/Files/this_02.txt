Blorkin flabble jumbled through the snazzleplop with a wonky doodlehorn, shouting “Zam! Zam!” at every fluffernut he saw. Grindlewump the third, wearing twelve socks on his elbows, danced the wibble-wobble around a glowing quackbucket. “Never trust a slorp with a wobbly chin,” he muttered, adjusting his marshmallow monocle.

Meanwhile, the zoodleberries were engaged in an intense game of tic-tac-splode, supervised by a semi-retired banana whisperer named Dooble. Cardboard thunder echoed across the squibblezone as three giggling flapdragons tap-danced on a soggy trampoline of logic.

Suddenly, with the force of seventeen invisible cheese slices, the great Snorkleplume arrived on a jet-powered spaghetti fork. “Who summoned the ancient noodle?” he bellowed, his eyebrows breakdancing with enthusiasm. A chorus of glibberwogs replied in perfect harmony, “Twiddle the fizzleknob!”

Chaos ensued as someone sneezed in interpretive Morse code. The trees began speaking backward in sarcasm, and a unicorn accountant filed taxes for a jellybean. By dusk, the only thing left standing was a confused toaster asking for directions.

Moral of the story? Never juggle pineapples during a cosmic sneeze contest.
