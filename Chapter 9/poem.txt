This is a Gemini generated poem.

At dawn's first light, as the world awakes anew,
A crossroads calls, where choices wait for you.
One path, well-trod, by ease and swift delight,
Whispers soft promises, through fading night.

The other, stark, ascends a rugged height,
Demanding discipline, with all its might.
Yet know this truth, held deep within your soul:
Discipline's not burden, but to make you whole.

It's self-love's purest form, a silent vow,
To who you'll be, your future self, right now.
Architect of destiny, with purpose clear,
Through every goal you've held, held ever dear.

The strength you seek, the wisdom you would claim,
Success you dream, a whisper of your name,
Not born of wishes, fleeting as the breeze,
But forged in fires, that effort brings with ease.

Let growth's sharp edge, a compass true and bright,
Guide to the person, in your inner light.
Embrace the grind, where daily battles cease,
For there, in constant effort, finds your peace.

Let discipline be bedrock, strong and deep,
Not for a season, but forever keep.
Feel its resolve, a fire in your core,
A burning light, to guide you evermore.

It's not just reaching, for a distant prize,
But in the becoming, where your true self lies.
So chase no dreams alone, with hopeful glance,
But outwork doubts, and seize your destined chance.
